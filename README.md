# Memory Management Program in C++

This repository contains a C++ program implementing memory management algorithms for process allocation. The code includes first fit, best fit, and worst fit strategies to allocate memory blocks to processes efficiently.

## Features
- **First Fit**: Allocates the first available memory block that is large enough for the process.
- **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest available memory block that can accommodate the process, reducing wasted space.
- **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available memory block to the process, leaving smaller blocks for future allocations.
